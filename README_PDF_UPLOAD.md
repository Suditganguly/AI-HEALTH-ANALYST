## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start Backend Server

cd server
npm start
```
Server runs on: `https://ai-health-analyst.onrender.com`

### 2. Start Frontend
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```
Frontend runs on: `https://ai-health-analyst.vercel.app/`

### 3. Test the Feature
1. Go to Profile Settings → Medical Info tab
2. Scroll to "Medical Documents Upload" section
3. Select a PDF file and upload

## 🧪 Test Files

- `test-upload.html` - Standalone test page for the upload API
- Open in browser and test upload functionality

## 📁 File Structure

│   ├── server.js         # Main server file
│   └── package.json
├── client/src/components/
│   ├── PDFUpload.jsx     # New upload component
│   └── ProfileSettings.jsx # Updated with PDF upload

## 🔧 API Endpoint

**POST** `/api/upload-pdf`
- Accepts: `multipart/form-data` with `pdf` field
- Returns: JSON with success status and file info
- Validates: PDF type, 10MB max size

## 🎯 Next Steps (Future Implementation)
- OCR processing of uploaded PDFs
- MongoDB integration for metadata
- User authentication
- File preview and management
- File categorization

## 🚨 Troubleshooting
- Ensure both servers are running
- Check console for error messages
- Verify file is PDF and under 10MB
- Check CORS settings if needed
